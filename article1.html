                        “For the first ten years of my career, I worked for Massimo Vignelli, a designer who is
                        legendary
                        for using a very limited number of typefaces. Between 1980 and 1990, most of my projects were
                        set in
                        five fonts: Helvetica (naturally), Futura, Garamond No. 3, Century Expanded, and, of course,
                        Bodoni.”
                    </p>
                    <p id="introText2" style='display:none'>
                        For Massimo, this was an ideological choice, an ethical imperative. "In the new computer age,"
                        he
                        once wrote, "the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of
                        visual
                        pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic
                        ones,
                        and trash the rest." For me, it became a time-saving device. Why spend hours choosing between
                        Bembo,
                        Sabon and Garamond No. 3 every time you needed a Venetian Roman? For most people ― my mom, for
                        instance ― these were distinctions without differences. Why not just commit to Garamond No. 3
                        and
                        never think about it again? My Catholic school education must have well prepared me for this
                        kind of
                        moral clarity. I accepted it gratefully.
                    </p>
                    <p id="introText3" style='display:none'>
                        Then, after a decade, I left my first job. Suddenly I could use any typeface I wanted, and I
                        went
                        nuts. On one of my first projects, I used 37 different fonts on 16 pages. My wife, who had
                        attended
                        Catholic school herself, found this all too familiar. She remembered classmates who had switched
                        to
                        public school after eight years under the nuns: freed at last from demure plaid uniforms, they
                        wore
                        the shortest skirts they could find. "Jesus," she said, looking at one of my multiple font
                        demolition derbies. "You've become a real slut, haven't you?"
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p id="introText4" style='display:none'>
                            It was true. Liberated from monogamy, I became typographically promiscuous. I have since, I
                            think,
                            learned to modulate my behavior ― like any substance abuser, I learned that binges are
                            time-consuming, costly, and ultimately counterproductive ― but I've never gone back to
                            five-typeface
                            sobriety. Those thousands of typefaces are still out there, but my recovery has requ ired
                            that I
                            become more discriminating and come up with some answers to this seemingly simple question:
                            why
                            choose a particular typeface? Here are thirteen reasons.

                                    is for. Careful, though: some typefaces work too well. Frutiger has been used so
                                    much for
                                    signage programs in hospitals and airports that seeing it now makes me feel that I’m

                                    I’ve heard of several projects where the designer found a font that was created the
                                    same
                                    year

                                    id="moreText2" style="display: none;">This must give the recommendation an aura of
                                    manifest
                                    destiny that is positively irresistible. I haven’t had that luck yet, but still try
                                    to find
                                    the
                                    same kind of evocative alignment. For instance, I was never a fan of Aldo Novarese’s
                                    Eurostyle,
                                    but I came to love it while working on a monograph on Eero Saarinen: they both share
                                    an
                                    expressiveness peculiar to the postwar optimism of the 1950’s.</span>

                                Once I saw a project in a student portfolio that undertook the dubious challenge of
                                redesigning
                                the Tiffany’s identity.</span><span id="dots3"> ...</span><span id="moreText3"
                                style="display: none;"> I particularly disliked the font that was used, and I politely
                                asked
                                what it was. “Oh,” came the enthusiastic response, “that’s the best part! It’s called
                                Tiffany!”
                                On the other hand, Bruce Mau designed Spectacle, the book he created with David
                                Rockwell,
                                using
                                the typeface Rockwell.
                                I thought this was funny.</span>

                                Once I was working on a project where the client group included some very strong-minded

                                style="display: none;">I picked Cheltenham, an idiosyncratic typeface that was not only
                                well-suited to
                                the
                                project's requirements, but was one of the few I know that was designed by an architect,
                                Bertram
                                Goodhue. Recently, I designed a publications program for a girls' school. I used a
                                typeface
                                that
                                was designed by a woman and named after another, Zuzana Licko's Mrs. Eaves. In both
                                cases,
                                my
                                clients knew that the public would be completely unaware of the story behind the font

                                but took some comfort in it nonetheless. I did too.</span>

                                based the logo on Bookman Swash Italic, a typeface I found unimaginably dated and ugly.

                                Glaser’s logo had replaced an earlier one by Peter Palazzo that was based on Caslon
                                Italic.
                                I
                                proposed we return to Caslon, and distinctly remember saying, “Bookman Swash Italic is

                                going to look ugly.” The other day, I saw something in the office that really caught my
                                eye.

                                was set in Bookman Swash Italic, and it looked great. Ugly, but great.</span>

                                pieces in a different typeface. I loved this idea, but wasn’t sure how far he’d want to
